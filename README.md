4. There are two very important components of the game, the 'Clue Box' and 'Cedric's Notebook', which can be freely accessed by the player in every scene of the game, and this is one of the main gameplay aspects of the game. Important clues in the story are automatically added to the 'Clue Box' based on plot advancement. The clues in the 'Clue Box' contain three categories, Character, Material and Testimony, and the clues are automatically categorized. 'Cedric's Notebook', on the other hand, is an important tool used by the player to take notes and perform deductive analysis, the information recorded and saved by the player will be persistently deposited on the hard disk and will be automatically loaded every time the game is played. This is due to the fact that the story presented in this game prototype is only a very small part of the game's main plot, and some of the notes taken by the player in each case will provide inspiration for the subsequent puzzle-solving process, and some are even directly related to the subsequent story.

**Concepts of the Game Prototype:**

- _**Slice Type:**_ _horizontal slice_.
- _**Explanations:**_ 
<br>
In choosing a horizontal slice approach for the development of my game prototype, I aim to comprehensively showcase the concepts and gameplay mechanisms outlined in the game design document. Instead of focusing on a specific function or mechanic, this development strategy enables me to present a complete chapter of the game, illustrating the continuity of the story and the player's role within it. My game prototype unveils a complete chapter of the detective puzzle game described in the Individual Game Pitch. Players will experience the core gameplay, including using clues from the clue box and Cedric's notebook to propel the story forward. These elements not only enhance the depth of gameplay and richness of the story but also increase player engagement and challenge.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, as a graphic-text puzzle game, the quality of images, visual effects, the integration of audio, the design of UI elements, and the construction of the plot require meticulous refinement in the later stages to enhance players' immersion. High-quality images and well-crafted visual effects are essential for attracting players' visual attention, while appropriate audio design enhances the game's atmosphere, drawing players deeper into the experience. Intuitive UI design ensures that players can navigate easily, and compelling plot construction keeps players interested and engaged. By carefully polishing these key aspects, we aim to provide players with a seamless and highly immersive game experience, allowing them to feel the depth and richness of the game world as they explore and solve puzzles.
